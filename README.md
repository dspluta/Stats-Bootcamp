# Stats-Bootcamp

This short course is designed to prepare incoming Statistics graduate students for the required first year PhD courses.  The topics and level of difficulty are intended for students with a background in mathematics and some experience with statistics.  The primary aims of this course are to provide you with a review of important background topics that will be needed in your first year courses, and to help you identify any areas you may need to focus on in your own studies.  Be aware that we may not cover all the important background topics in sufficient depth, and all students are expected to study and prepare on their own to ensure they are adequately prepared.  This course is strongly recommended for all Statistics PhD students, and open to all Statistics Masters students.
